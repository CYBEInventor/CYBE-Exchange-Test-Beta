# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Add Ons To The CYBE Exchange
- Implement, Test, Final Deploy for my upgradeable exchange and tokens
- Add popular tokens and unpopular tokens for trading. Add, Test, Attempt To Break, Final Deploy. Make sure these well-known tokens are tradable with no errors and horrible pump-n-dumps


# Final Touches and Deployment Notes
- Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Kovan testnets from the Infura API on October 5th, 2022. So my first network will be Goerli
- My CYBE Exchange will be on the testnets for now. I will grow a more consistent audience for more users of my Dapps (Decentralized Applications). Than this will grow my existing conglomerate since i will be attaching more Dapps to my main website
- I will have the test and non-test networks included in my config.json and hardhat.config.js
- without any added steps for deployment the other networks
- CYBE Exchange will have my offical token with added code from this demostration file.
- In coding my token into the test networks and blockchains, i will change the color or overall design of the svg
- Also i will change the symbol of eth to polygon for the munbai network (polygon test network)
- The official exchange will be connected to the official website of CYBE Exchange
